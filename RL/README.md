#### Reinforcement Learning (Sutton & Barto)

---

    * Deadly Triad : brings instability.
    
        1) bootstrapping (e.g. Q-learning / SARSA)
        2) off-policy learning 
        3) non-linear FA (e.g. neural network)


    * confusing MDP names
    
        1) Discrete MDP (finite MDP) vs Continuous MDP (infinite MDP)
            
            Discrete MDP => the state, action, and reward sets are finite (discrete)
            Continuous MDP => the state, action, and reward are infinite (continuous)
        
        2) Deterministic MDP vs Stochastic MDP
            
            Deterministic MDP => deterministic policy
            Stochastic MDP => stochastic policy
